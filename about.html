      In a world of complex apps, we believe learning fundamental art skills should be simple and safe. Creative Coloring was born from the idea that teaching a child to draw and color should be as easy as opening a browser.

  <h2>The Benefits of Learning to Draw and Color</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 40px; font-size: 1.1em;">
    Creative Coloring is more than just a game—it's a tool for your child's development. Here are the skills they can build:
  </p>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Improved Fine Motor Skills</h3>
      <p>The act of selecting colors and filling in shapes helps children practice hand-eye coordination and strengthens the muscles in their hands needed for drawing and writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Enhanced Concentration</h3>
      <p>Focusing on a drawing and coloring task helps improve a child's attention span and ability to concentrate, building valuable skills for school and other activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Color & Shape Recognition</h3>
      <p>As they play, children learn to identify different colors and shapes, building a fundamental vocabulary for understanding art and the world around them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Artistic Confidence</h3>
      <p>Learning to draw and color provides a creative outlet for self-expression. Completing a picture gives children a sense of accomplishment and boosts their artistic confidence.</p>
