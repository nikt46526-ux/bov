</div>

<div class='card'>
<h3>Can we save my child's artwork?</h3>
<p>Yes! After your child has finished a drawing, a 'Save' button allows you to download the image. This is a great way to track their progress and share their achievements.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h3>Can my child learn on a tablet or phone?</h3>
<p>Yes. The game is fully responsive and designed to work perfectly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The large buttons are easy for little fingers to tap, making learning accessible anywhere.</p>
</div>

<div class='card'>
<h3>How does my child interact with the game?</h3>
<p>The controls are simple: tap a color, then tap the area of the drawing to fill it. This intuitive "paint bucket" style is designed for touch and mouse, helping kids focus on color choices rather than complex controls.</p>

<h3>Is this learning game free to use?</h3>
