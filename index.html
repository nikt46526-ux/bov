  <h2>How Kids Learn with Creative Coloring</h2>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Pick a Picture</h3>
      <p>Your child can choose from a gallery of drawing templates. Starting with a pre-drawn image helps them understand shapes and composition as they prepare to add color.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Choose Your Colors</h3>
      <p>Next, they select colors from the palette. This step teaches them about color names and encourages them to think about which colors will look best together in their drawing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Create a Masterpiece</h3>
      <p>As they fill in the drawing, children experiment with color combinations and develop their artistic style. This process builds confidence and improves their creative decision-making skills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Save and Share</h3>
      <p>Once their drawing is complete, you can save it to your device. This allows you to track their progress and share their achievements, reinforcing their new skills.</p>
